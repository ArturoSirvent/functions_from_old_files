# Old files function gathering
List, group and distinguis between functions contained into multiple files.

When dealing with a large amount of old code files, each one containing functions that you may need, it is very difficult to check, compare and take care of all the functions contained in it. In my case, it is done with the objective of gathering them into a well structured module.
It is by now a simple snippet of code that lists all the functions contained in multiple files, indicating the file they come from.
However, I will like to continue the project and make it easier to distinguish between multiple versions of the same function etc.
